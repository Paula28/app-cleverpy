### `How to Use the Project`

**MAIN Home**.\
In the home we will see all the posts that our users have published. The logged in user will see a menu that will consist of our company logo that is on the left, with this option you can click and return to the menu if you are on a different screen, on the right you will find your name and email as welcome and a button logout where he can close his session when he finishes seeing all the posts.
In the body we will find all the posts and the user will see two icons on his card that will allow him to edit or delete according to the choice he wishes to make. And if you click on the card you will be able to access the post where it will show you the post in more detail and you will be able to see the comments of the different users.

**DETAIL POST**

In the detail of the post the user will see the menu again and will also be able to see in detail the entire post and all the comments it has.

**EDIT POST**
In the edit post you will see the menu again with its respective options and the user will only be able to edit their post and they will be shown a form where they can edit the title and body of their post, and they will see two buttons that are cancel and save if He does not want to save what he has done, he can click on the cancel button and he will return to home and if he wants to save what he has written for his post, he only has to click on the save button.

You will see the delete post in the home page and it will show a pop up in the form of a message that will make sure that the user has not clicked incorrectly and deletes your post without wanting it and if, on the contrary, you want to delete it, once it has been deleted, the page will be refreshed and The post we had previously is no longer displayed
